Just add it as normal plugin into your EEGLAB's plugin folder. Path etc. is handles by EEGLAB itself and it works like a charm.\r\n\r\nAfter you load your segmented dataset you have to select only one type of stimuli (event type) and then you can run computation of frontal alpha asymmetry index.\r\n\r\n# How can you contribute?\r\nIt would need a bit help. So feel free to contribute (tweak the code and push it into the repository - this project is open source). Or you can simple write an email and I will be in touch with you.",
