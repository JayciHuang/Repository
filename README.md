# How does it works?
## Prerequisites
Toolbox runs in MATLAB's EEGLAB software, which you can download here:
[https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/)

About adding the path into MATLAB for installing EEGLAB [more here](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/112827-how-to-add-eeglab-toolbox-to-matlab-7-12-0)

## Install plugin
Download plugin from source here at GitHub. Unzip the latest version and copy it into your EEGLAB plugin folder. If you have already added a path into EEGLAB you are ready to go and Frontal Alpha Asymmetry Toolbox should work. If not please add your matlab into your path.

# How can you contribute?
It would need a bit help. So feel free to contribute (tweak the code and push it into the repository - this project is open source). Or you can simple write an email and I will be in touch with you.
